1. Introduction
Based upon both pedagogical and financial considerations, PAMCAM (Personnel
Allocation Model Contribution Margin Assessment Model) is a free, open resource
mathematical model designed to inform decision-making related to the management
of faculty personnel and corresponding credit-bearing academic activity centers in
higher education. The operations of instruction delivery associated with an academic
activity center vary along a continuum spanning from a single course section to the
entire university academic portfolio. PAMCAM brings forth no new ideas from a
mathematics or finance standpoint. Furthermore, the nature of PAMCAM analysis has
been routinely performed at universities since the 1990’s with variations in
terminology, emphasis areas, depth, and breadth of analysis. What appears to be
novel for PAMCAM, however, is 1) how the change in contribution margin is
disaggregated into two parts that elucidate the separate effects of enrollment growth
and student-faculty ratio change, and 2) how information is graphically
communicated using a four-sided design envelope that captures key considerations
commonly made amid discussions around personnel and academic activity center
management. These differences introduce fertile ground for faculty and
administrators to more effectively communicate their perspective and understand
others’ perspectives using a common vocabulary with a clearly understood definition
of terms.
The evaluation process around faculty personnel and academic program decisionmaking should feature transparency, clarity, adequate time for absorption of
information, and data-informed rationale. PAMCAM is useful for establishing a
foundation for such a process. The motivation for the use of PAMCAM, therefore, is
to help advance a healthy shared governance environment as faculty personnel and
academic activity center decisions are made.
2. Activity Centers
Within the context of PAMCAM analysis, the contribution margin captures the
difference between an academic activity center’s revenue and expenses associated
with customers and employees, respectively. Customers may be primarily envisioned
collectively as students and prospective employers for whom they wish to work.
2

Employees are the faculty whose services are curriculum delivery and peripheral
supporting engagement. As such, the apparatus supporting direct operations of
instruction delivery associated with a single course section, discipline area, degreemajor, academic program, department, school, college, or university may comprise
an academic activity center.
PAMCAM was first introduced (Smith, et al., 2022) in the form of a relatively complexlooking model, and later presented in a more succinct and understandable model
format (Smith, 2025); elements of the later article are summarized herein. As
explained in both articles, the PAMCAM contribution margin does not account for
fixed (or nearly fixed) costs. Such fixed costs include but are not limited to those
related to support staff, custodial services, landscaping, police, property insurance,
and utilities. These costs are insensitive to relatively small changes in enrollment and
student faculty ratio. Because the change in contribution margin due to a change in
enrollment or change in student-faculty ratio is a central mathematical pillar for
PAMCAM, such fixed costs are ignored. The contribution margin for an academic
activity center, therefore, should almost always be equal to or greater than zero. They
are considered profit centers in support of other activities within an encompassing,
non-profit academic enterprise. A culture in which discussions around change in
contribution margin are integrated into strategic planning and execution helps
establish a strong and inclusive foundation for teamwork, entrepreneurship,
creativity, and a competitive advantage for an institution of higher education.
3. Contribution Margin
The contribution margin for PAMCAM is expressed in (1) below. Students and faculty
are defined in terms of full-time student equivalents (FTES) and full-time faculty
equivalents (FTEF), respectively.
𝑠

𝑚 = (𝑡 + 𝑎 ∙ 𝑓 − ) ∙ 𝑛
𝑅

where:
𝑚 is the annual contribution margin ($)
𝑡 is the weighted avg annual tuition per student ($/FTES)
𝑎 is the weighted avg annual credit hours per student (SCH/ FTES)

𝑓
𝑠
𝑅
𝑛

is the weighted avg annual state formula funding per credit hour ($/SCH)
is the weighted avg annual salary per faculty ($/FTEF)
is the annualized student-faculty ratio (FTES/FTEF)
is the annualized enrollment (FTES)

4. Design Envelope
In Figure 1, the previous, current, and projected states of an academic activity center
are denoted by points 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The PAMCAM design envelope may
be envisioned as the permissible space in which an academic activity center may
reside. It is bound by four lines, as illustrated in Figure 1. The slope of the lower line
(Line A) is determined by constraining (1) to be equal to or greater than zero, then
solving for R. This lower line represents the financial break-even boundary below
which the contribution margin is negative. Therefore, an academic activity center
located above this lower line is profitable; this lower boundary is a financial
constraint. The slope of the upper line (Line B) is the student-faculty ratio above which
pedagogical quality is unacceptably low; this upper boundary is a pedagogical
constraint typically proposed by a faculty program coordinator and subject to
approval by a dean, director, and/or department chair. The placement of the left-hand
and right-hand boundaries are prescribed, based upon functional and
aspirational/space considerations, respectively.
5. Change in Faculty
PAMCAM yields the change in faculty, 𝑑𝑝, required to move the center to a position
along the top boundary of the design envelope; this is at the intersection of Line B
and C in Figure 1. As such, 𝑑𝑝 is calculated according to the following relationship.
𝑑𝑝 =

𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙
𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥

− 𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙

(2)

where:
𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 is the final FTES coordinate
𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the slope of the line coincident with the top line of the design envelope
𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 is the initial FTEF coordinate
4

6. Change in Contribution Margin
Any state (ie. location) within the PAMCAM design envelope is satisfactory from a
financial perspective. The optimum financial state, however, is at the projected Point
3 in Figure 1; this state corresponds to maximum financial efficiency under the
prescribed conditions. Therefore, the PAMCAM model is designed to conform to a
principle of maximum financial efficiency. Anywhere within the design envelope or
along its boundaries is pedagogically permissible. The optimum location, therefore,
in the PAMCAM design envelope is along the top boundary at which both the
principle of maximum financial efficiency and pedagogical-based constraints are
satisfied.
5

A change in enrollment, 𝑑𝑛, and/or a change in student-faculty ratio, 𝑑𝑅, leads to
movement of the academic activity center’s state from Point 2 to Point 3 which in
turn leads to a change in its contribution margin. While motion from Point 2 to 3 for
some academic activity centers will feature a positive contribution margin, others will
feature a negative contribution margin. Decision-makers within the college should
manage this dynamic by reallocating financial resources strategically.
With the understanding that everyone on campus plays a role in enrollment
management, the impact of an individual’s decision-making on enrollment is not
always clear because there exists a myriad of internal and external factors that also
influence enrollment. Thus, the dean, director, and chair’s connection to the 𝑑𝑛
“lever” is mostly reactive. The 𝑑𝑅 lever is fundamentally different. It can more easily
be controlled through intentional actions within a college. Adding an additional
lecturer or not backfilling a recently vacated tenured position will affect 𝑑𝑅. Thus, the
dean, director, and chair’s connection to the 𝑑𝑅 “lever” is mostly proactive. It follows,
therefore, that a manager would find useful a deeper understanding of the difference
between the impact of their reactive and proactive decision-making has on academic
activity center contribution margins in their college. The PAMCAM model
quantitatively shows this difference both numerically and graphically.
Let the change in 𝑚, 𝑅, and 𝑛 be denoted by 𝑑𝑚, 𝑑𝑅, and 𝑑𝑛, respectively. From (1),
it is seen that 𝑚 is nonlinear with respect to 𝑅. Also, the impact of 𝑛 is dependent
upon 𝑅; there is an interaction between the two. An efficient way to accurately
separate the portion of 𝑑𝑚 due to 𝑑𝑅 from the portion of 𝑑𝑚 due to 𝑑𝑛 is to employ
an approximation model involving a Taylor series expansion described within the field
of differential calculus (Weir, et al., 2015). For this current PAMCAM model, a tenth
order Taylor series expansion model is introduced in (3) for the change in contribution
margin, 𝑑𝑚, as a function of a change in enrollment, 𝑑𝑛, and a change in studentfaculty ratio, 𝑑𝑅.

7. Graphical User Interface
PAMCAM may be built on various platforms and presented in graphical and/or
numerical formats. Examples of suitable platforms are spreadsheets, web-based
applications, and mobile phone applications. The current version is available in EXCEL.
Because it has a built-in macro, it has an “xlsm” extension. The EXCEL model features
five tabs: Sandbox, College 1, College, 2, College 3, College 4, and Division. Within the
sandbox, users may engage in experimental analysis without affecting any other tab.
Information in the college tabs, however, rolls into the division tab. Provided they are
correctly coupled to the division tab, the four college tabs could be replaced with tabs
for any number of colleges, departments, academic programs, or discipline areas. A
web-based Sandbox as well as the EXCEL model are available at the free, open
resource website at ……. (under construction).
Navigating the PAMCAM user interface is relatively simple, provided one understands
the meaning of the input data and has access to reliable data. A user’s understanding
of the mathematical formulation shown in (3) is not essential to their effective use of
PAMCAM. The following steps are recommended as an introductory process:
A. Activity Center: Decide on the type of academic activity center to be evaluated,
in consultation with the office of institutional research, the division budget
office, stakeholders within the college and the provost’s office (hereafter called
“stakeholders”). Unless there exists a compelling reason to do otherwise, the
academic activity center analysis should begin at the discipline area level.
7

Results based upon PAMCAM analysis for discipline areas will roll into, for
example, departments, colleges, and the division for subsequent PAMCAM
analysis. This process is illustrated in the next section.
B. Students and Faculty: Decide on how FTES and FTEF are to be calculated in
consultation with stakeholders. To account for service effects, FTES calculations
should be based upon credit hours associated with any student in the
classroom, regardless of their major, unless there exists a compelling reason to
do otherwise. FTEF calculations should be based upon those instructors who
teach students seated in the classroom, regardless of the instructor’s home
department. For the purposes of PAMCAM analysis, these instructors are
affiliated with the department that manages the discipline area. These
approaches are not necessary, but they are recommended. The key is
consistency across analysis among stakeholders throughout the division.
C. Basic Input: Input estimated values for t, a, f, s, n, and p in the maroonhighlighted fields. Also input a value for the projected percent enrollment
change from state 2 to 3; this is used to determine 𝑑𝑛 from state 2 to 3. Do not
invest an unnecessary amount of time quibbling over the exact values. There
will never be universal consensus on exact numbers. Noting that PAMCAM
provides estimated values, stakeholders should consult with each other, agree
on an estimate, then move on.
D. Strategic Input: This refers primarily to specification of the maximum student
faculty ratio, 𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 , which defines the top line of the design envelope.
Prescription of 𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 for state 3 allows for the calculation of 𝑑𝑅 from state 2 to
3. In addition to 𝑑𝑛, the value for 𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 will have a major impact on PAMCAM’s
recommended change in faculty, 𝑑𝑝.
E. Adjusting the Graphs: Both graphs (as well as various cells) will automatically
change, based upon changes to the input fields. The design envelope and/or
arrows depicting changes in state may vanish from the space in the graphs. To
reset graph layout, hit “control-q”. If there is a desire to establish one’s own
custom scale on the graphs, they may double-click on the axes to make changes
per the standard EXCEL process.
F. Sharing Results: To share PAMCAM results, hit “Control-p” to print out a onepage hardcopy or pdf.

8. Fictitious Illustrative Case Study
As part of a division-level action plan, the dean of College A tasks the chair of
Department A1 to assess their faculty hiring needs for their department. The
department chair, in turn, reaches out to the program coordinators for collection of
data to help support a recommendation. Working with the office of institutional
research, the program coordinators populate rows one through twenty-six in Table 1
with data for five discipline areas (with nonsensical names): Candles, Origami,
Balloons, Presents, and Games. All five discipline areas apply to undergraduate-level
course work for which 15 credit hours per term are considered full-time for students.
The university academic year encompasses four terms: Fall, Winter, Spring, and
Summer.
For the CAND 100 courses delivered in the fall, shown in row 2, there is a headcount
(HC) of 77 students. Since CAND 100 is a 3-credit course, each student seated in the
classroom represents 3/15 FTES. The total number of FTES, therefore, is 77 x (3/15)
or 15.40. Alternatively, the 15.40 FTES could have been calculated by determining the
total number of credit hours (231), then dividing 231 by 15.
Courses shown in Table 1 are taught by various combinations of part-time faculty (ie.
adjunct), lecturers, tenure-track faculty, visiting scholars, and graduate students. The
seventy-seven students in CAND 100 for the fall are taught in four sections, two each
by an adjunct faculty, and two each by a tenure-track faculty resulting in a total FTEF
of 0.8 The resulting SFR is 19.25 for the current year. For the previous year, a similar
analysis is carried out leading to a total of 14.80 FTES and 0.65 FTEF for fall CAND 100.
Continuing to work closely with the office of institutional research, the program
coordinators prescribed a projected growth in FTES of 7.80% for the projected (next)
year for fall CAND 100. Similar analysis was performed for the winter, spring, and
summer terms for Candles leading to the roll-up shown in row 6.
The 7.28% projected growth rate is determined by computing the weighted average
of the individual course %FTES values using their total SCH’s for weights. Working
closely with fellow faculty and in consultation with the department chair, the program
coordinators prescribe a maximum SFR of 18; this value is based upon carefully
weighed pedagogical considerations. The program coordinator notes that 1) the
9

current 18.67 SFR exceeds the maximum 18.00 SFR, and 2) the demand for Candles
is projected to grow at a strong rate of 7.28%.
The following estimates were made by the program coordinators, in consultation with
the office of institutional research and other stakeholders, for the current year for
Candles:
• Average annual tuition per FTES, t:
• Average annual SCH per FTES, a:
• Average annual state support per SCH:
• Average annual salary/benefits per FTEF:

$8,000/FTES
32 SCH/FTES
$100/SCH
$90,000/FTEF

These values were used for all analysis in this illustrative section. In practice however,
some or all of them would vary across discipline areas.
PAMCAM results for Candles are shown in Figure 2. In conjunction with market
demand data, space requirements, and other considerations, the coordinator
discusses the PAMCAM results with the department chair and others in the
department and college. The two arrows depict Candle’s change in state from
previous-to-current and from current-to-projected. Candles currently “lives” outside
of (above) the permissible design envelope, as shown by the head of the first arrow.
The PAMCAM model indicates an increase of 0.34 FTEF is needed to place Candles at
its optimal location along the top boundary of the design envelope.
The values shown in the center-highlighted cell within the two heat maps at the
bottom of the PAMCAM results page automatically correspond approximately to
PAMCAM’s recommended change to SFR (-3.57% or -0.67), the prescribed change in
enrollment (7.28% or 4.08) and PAMCAM’s recommended change to faculty (11.25%
or 0.34). These heat maps provide additional quick-reference PAMCAM solutions
without having to experiment with various combinations of input. After consideration
of these heat maps and further consultation with stakeholders, the coordinator
recommends hiring the 0.34 additional FTEF.
The contribution margin for Candles is $357,400 for the previous state (Year 1). Both
FTES and FTEF grow when moving from previous state (Year 1) to the current state
(Year 2). This results in a contribution margin of $357,200 for the current state. Even
10

with a 0.34 FTEF increase, the contribution margin grows further to $372,476. The
right-hand graph in Figure 3 graphically shows the trend.
When moving from the current to projected state (ie. from Year 2 to Year 3), the total
change in contribution margin is $15,276, despite a 0.67 decrease in SFR at a cost of
$10,000 for an additional 0.34 FTEF. Candles is a growing profit center that the
program coordinator considers worthy of strong consideration of a $10,000
investment in FTEF. (In practice, the actual increase in FTEF would have likely been a
multiple of 0.05, say 0.25 or 0.40, due to how the workloads are calculated.)
Other program coordinators proceed with similar analysis for the other four discipline
areas. As shown in Figure 3, Origami is trending in an unfavorable way. Its financial
contribution to the university is $27,724 less for the current year than it was for the
previous year. Yet, it still contributes to the university $94,776 for the current year. To
rectify Origami’s unfavorable trend, the coordinator considers PAMCAM’s solution
which would lead to an additional $12,619 in funding for the university, which in turn
would lead to Origami delivering to the university $107,395 annually. This would
require a reduction of 0.29 Origami FTEF. When shown these results, the department
chair contemplates asking the dean to advocate for a portion of the $12,619 from
Origami to help pay for the additional Candles FTEF.
PAMCAM results for Balloons suggest a need to reduce the number of FTEF by 0.74
thereby liberating $85,122 in funds to be invested elsewhere as shown in Figure 4.
Presents is in trouble, as shown in Figure 5; it currently operates at an approximate
break-even state while its headcount is at ten or less for all four terms. It is taught,
however, by an adjunct faculty who has support from the coordinator who insists the
course is an essential part of the curriculum. PAMCAM shows a required 0.22
reduction in FTEF, leading to the likelihood of collapsing the current set of sections
into a set of fewer sections. Proactively, the coordinator consults with the academic
advisor and department chair to mitigate possible roadblocks for students’ efficient
progress toward graduation.
Figure 6 shows a healthy trend for Games, leading to a required 0.04 increase in FTEF;
again, due to how workloads are calculated, this small value would likely be
interpreted as zero. PAMCAM results for the Department A1 roll-up are shown in
11

Figure 7. The maximum SFR of 18.06 (row 29 in Table 1) was not prescribed arbitrarily.
It had to satisfy the following constraint:
𝑚3,𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙 − 𝑚2,𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙 = ∑𝑧𝑖=1 𝑑𝑚𝑖
where:

(4a)

𝑚3 and 𝑚2 are the contribution margin for projected and current states,
respectively, for the roll-up center
“roll” denotes roll-up center (in this case, it is Department A)
z = # units rolled into the roll-up center (in this case, it is 5)
𝑑𝑚1 , 𝑑𝑚2 , 𝑑𝑚3 , 𝑑𝑚4 , 𝑑𝑚5 are the change in contribution margins for
the centers being rolled into the roll-up center. (In this case, they are
Candles, Origami, Balloons, Presents, and Games.)
∑𝑧𝑖=1 𝑑𝑚𝑖 is determined to be $162,459 from Figures 3 - 7.

Application of (1) to (4a), then solving for 𝑅3 leads to:
𝑅3 =

𝑠∙𝑛3
𝑠
𝑧
(𝑡+𝑎∙𝑓)∙𝑛3 −∑𝑖=1 𝑑𝑚𝑖 − (𝑡+𝑎∙𝑓− )∙𝑛2
𝑅2

(4b)

For Department A1, the maximum SFR (ie. 𝑅3 ) is calculated to be 18.06.
The department chair examines the PAMCAM results shown in Figure 7, noting that
the 0.91 FTEF net decrease leads to a department contribution margin change in the
amount of $162,459. Similar analysis is carried out for the other departments,
colleges, and the division leading to results shown in Figures 8 – 14.
As shown in Figure 10, the dean of College A will introduce a contribution margin
change of $235,450. First, and without considering the use of this $235,450, the dean
redistributes funding within the college, noting the differences in contribution margin
changes across the departments; these transactions would be for the following
academic year. Second, if the dean provides sufficient justification (or pursuant to an
RCM-type budget model), the dean may have access to a portion of the $235,450 for
strategic investment into college-related initiatives. The chairs exercise a similar
option within their departments.
12

While College A shows a projected positive contribution margin change of a (surplus)
$235,450, Colleges B, C, and D show projections of a deficit of $220,012, surplus
$1,016,103, and deficit $800,724, respectively. The resulting division roll-up leads to
a projected contribution margin change of a surplus $230,818. The provost also
considers redistribution across various areas within the division, based upon
consultation with various stakeholders and/or pursuant to an RCM-type of budget
model which rewards performance – all in harmony with the president’s vision for
the university.
