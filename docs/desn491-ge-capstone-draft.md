## 1. Breadth Area Justification

*Paste this into the "Breadth Area Justification" field in CIM.*

DESN 491 Practicum is a Senior Capstone course because students will:

**Integrate knowledge and skills acquired in their degree.** In DESN 491, students undertake a self-directed professional design project that requires them to synthesize competencies developed across the Design curriculum. Students draw on foundational skills in typography (DESN 216), visual composition (DESN 263), and design thinking (DESN 100); intermediate skills in branding (DESN 305), publication design (DESN 336), user experience (DESN 350), and motion graphics (DESN 384); and advanced skills in campaign strategy and design systems developed in upper-division coursework. The practicum project demands that students integrate these discrete competencies into a cohesive, professional-quality body of work — no single course in the curriculum prepares them for this level of integration on its own.

**Complete, with formative feedback, a master-level product or a series of products.** Students produce two linked deliverables: (1) a professional design project (such as a comprehensive brand identity system, a multi-platform publication, a UX prototype, or a visual communication campaign) and (2) a written design case study documenting the project's rationale, process, and outcomes. Both deliverables are developed through a structured, iterative feedback cycle. Students submit a project proposal with initial research (weeks 2-3), present design concepts alongside a draft case study introduction for faculty critique (week 5), submit refined designs with an expanded case study for a second faculty critique (weeks 7-8), and deliver the final project and completed case study at the end of the quarter (week 10). Faculty provide substantive formative feedback at each milestone, and students are expected to demonstrate meaningful revision in response to that feedback.

**Demonstrate abilities acquired in their degree to think creatively.** The professional design project requires students to embrace contradictions by integrating alternate or divergent perspectives into their design solutions — for example, balancing client objectives with user needs, or reconciling aesthetic goals with functional constraints. Students synthesize ideas by connecting visual, typographic, and strategic concepts in novel ways that go beyond reproducing existing design conventions. The final deliverable must demonstrate innovative thinking through the creation of an original design solution — a unique visual identity, a novel user experience, or a creative communication strategy — that did not exist before the student conceived it.

**Demonstrate their ability to communicate in writing in the disciplinary context of their degree.** The written design case study requires students to articulate complex design decisions in clear, organized prose for a professional audience. Students must clarify the purpose of their document by defining the design problem their project addresses and the goals it achieves. They must convey meaning clearly by explaining their design rationale — why specific typographic, compositional, and strategic choices were made — in language accessible to both designers and non-designers. The case study must be organized logically, following a professional structure: problem definition, research and discovery, design process, solution, and outcomes. Finally, students must make appropriate choices about style, tone, and complexity for their intended audience — whether that audience is a potential employer reviewing a portfolio, a client evaluating a deliverable, or a peer in a design critique. Writing effectively about design work is a core professional competency: designers must routinely explain and defend their decisions in proposals, presentations, and portfolio documentation.

## 2. GE Learning Outcomes

*Paste this into the "GE Learning Outcomes" field in CIM.*

**Creative Thinking (Group 1):** DESN 491 develops creative thinking through the professional design project, which requires students to integrate divergent perspectives (client needs, user research, aesthetic goals, technical constraints), synthesize visual and strategic ideas in novel combinations, and produce an original design solution. The iterative critique process — in which faculty challenge assumptions and push students beyond initial concepts — mirrors professional creative practice and ensures students move beyond formulaic solutions toward genuinely innovative work.

**Written Communication (Group 2):** DESN 491 develops written communication through the design case study, a 1,500–2,500 word document in which students articulate the rationale, process, and outcomes of their design project. Writing about design decisions for a professional audience is a core disciplinary skill: designers must explain and defend their work in client proposals, portfolio narratives, and project documentation. The case study requires students to define a clear purpose, convey complex visual concepts in accessible prose, organize their narrative logically, and adapt their writing style to the intended audience.

## 3. Complex Assignment: Professional Design Project

*Paste this into the "Complex Assignments" field in CIM (first assignment).*

Students develop a professional-quality design project over the course of the quarter, selected in consultation with their faculty advisor. Projects may include a comprehensive brand identity system, a multi-platform publication design, a UX/UI prototype, a visual communication campaign, or a comparable deliverable appropriate to the student's area of emphasis within the Design major. In this assignment students will demonstrate the ability to think creatively by:

**Embracing contradictions by integrating alternate, divergent, or contradictory perspectives or ideas.**
Students begin by conducting audience and context research that surfaces competing requirements — for instance, a client's desire for a traditional brand aesthetic versus user research indicating a preference for modern, minimal design, or the tension between visual impact and accessibility standards. Students must reconcile these contradictions in their design solution rather than ignoring them. During the week-5 faculty critique, the advisor provides formative feedback specifically evaluating how well the student has identified and addressed competing perspectives, and students revise their approach in response before the week-7-8 critique.

**Synthesizing ideas by connecting ideas or solutions in novel ways.**
Students combine visual, typographic, strategic, and technical concepts drawn from across the Design curriculum into an integrated solution. For example, a branding project might synthesize motion graphics principles (DESN 384) with traditional identity design (DESN 305) and UX interaction patterns (DESN 350) to create a cohesive, multi-touchpoint brand experience. Faculty provide formative feedback at the week-5 and week-7-8 critiques evaluating the originality and coherence of the synthesis, pushing students to move beyond predictable combinations toward unexpected but effective connections.

**Engaging in innovative thinking by creating a novel or unique idea, question, format, or product.**
The final deliverable must represent an original creative contribution — not a reproduction of existing work or a template-based exercise. Students produce a design solution that addresses a real or realistic problem in a way that did not previously exist. The iterative feedback cycle (proposal → concepts → refined design → final) is structured so that early-stage formative feedback challenges students to push past their initial ideas. Faculty evaluate the final project on the degree to which it demonstrates genuine creative risk-taking and originality.

## 4. Complex Assignment: Written Design Case Study

*Paste this into the "Complex Assignments" field in CIM (second assignment).*

Students write a 1,500–2,500 word design case study documenting and contextualizing their professional design project. The case study is a standard professional genre in the design field — designers use case studies to present their work in portfolios, client presentations, and professional publications. The case study is developed in parallel with the design project, with written drafts submitted at the same critique milestones. In this assignment students will demonstrate the ability to communicate in writing by:

**Clarifying the purpose of the document.**
Students open the case study by defining the design problem their project addresses: who the audience is, what need or gap exists, and what the project aims to accomplish. This section functions as a thesis statement grounding the entire document. During the week-5 critique, faculty provide formative feedback on whether the problem statement is clearly articulated and sufficiently specific — a vague or overly broad problem definition must be revised before the student proceeds.

**Conveying the meaning clearly throughout the document.**
Students explain their design rationale — the reasoning behind specific typographic, compositional, color, and strategic choices — in language accessible to both design professionals and non-specialist readers (such as clients or hiring managers). This requires translating visual decisions into verbal explanations without relying on jargon or assuming the reader can infer intent from the visuals alone. Faculty provide formative feedback at the week-5 and week-7-8 critiques evaluating the clarity and completeness of the written rationale, identifying areas where meaning is ambiguous or assumes too much prior knowledge.

**Organizing their document logically.**
Students structure the case study following a professional case study format: (1) problem definition, (2) research and discovery, (3) design process and iteration, (4) final solution, and (5) outcomes or reflection. This organizational structure mirrors both professional portfolio standards and the logical progression of a design project. Faculty provide formative feedback on structural coherence — whether sections flow logically, whether transitions connect ideas effectively, and whether the reader can follow the project narrative from problem to solution.

**Making choices concerning style, tone, and degree of complexity that are appropriate to the audience.**
Students must identify their intended audience (e.g., a portfolio audience of prospective employers, a client audience, or a peer audience of fellow designers) and calibrate their writing accordingly. A case study aimed at a hiring manager requires different tone and technical depth than one aimed at a design critique panel. Faculty provide formative feedback evaluating whether the writing style, vocabulary, and level of technical detail are appropriate for the stated audience, and students revise their approach based on this feedback.

## 5. Rubrics

### Creative Thinking Rubric

*Paste this into the "Assignment Rubrics" field in CIM (or attach as a document).*

| Student Learning Outcome | Excellent | Proficient | Non-Proficient | Poor or Absent |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Integrates alternate, divergent, or contradictory perspectives or ideas.** | Design solution demonstrates sophisticated integration of competing requirements (e.g., client goals, user needs, accessibility, aesthetics). Contradictions are resolved creatively rather than ignored. | Design solution acknowledges and addresses multiple perspectives. Some contradictions are resolved effectively. | Design solution addresses a single perspective without meaningful engagement with competing requirements. | No evidence of engaging with alternate or contradictory perspectives. |
| **Connects ideas or solutions in novel ways.** | Design solution synthesizes concepts from multiple areas of the curriculum in original, unexpected combinations that produce a coherent and effective result. | Design solution combines concepts from multiple areas in ways that are effective, though the combinations may be somewhat expected. | Design solution applies concepts from the curriculum but does not combine them in ways that go beyond standard or formulaic approaches. | Design solution relies on a single technique or approach with no evidence of synthesis. |
| **Creates a novel or unique idea, question, format, or product.** | Final deliverable represents a genuinely original creative contribution that demonstrates risk-taking and innovation. The solution could not have been predicted from the initial proposal. | Final deliverable is original and demonstrates creative effort, though it may stay within familiar territory. | Final deliverable is competent but derivative — it resembles existing work or relies heavily on templates/conventions. | Final deliverable shows no originality or creative effort. |

### Written Communication Rubric

| Student Learning Outcome | Excellent | Proficient | Non-Proficient | Poor or Absent |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Clarify the purpose of the document.** | Problem statement is specific, compelling, and clearly frames the entire case study. Reader immediately understands what the project addresses and why it matters. | Problem statement is clear and provides adequate context for the case study. | Problem statement is vague, overly broad, or does not clearly connect to the project. | No identifiable problem statement or purpose. |
| **Convey meaning clearly throughout the document.** | Design rationale is explained clearly and completely. Complex visual decisions are translated into accessible language. A non-designer reader can understand why specific choices were made. | Design rationale is mostly clear. Most decisions are explained, though some passages may rely on jargon or assume prior knowledge. | Writing is unclear in multiple places. Design decisions are stated but not explained, or explanations are confusing. | Writing is incoherent or absent. Design decisions are not explained. |
| **Organize document logically.** | Case study follows a clear, professional structure. Sections flow logically from problem to solution. Transitions effectively connect ideas. | Case study is organized with identifiable sections, though flow between sections may occasionally be unclear. | Organization is inconsistent. Sections may be out of order or missing. Reader has difficulty following the narrative. | No discernible organizational structure. |
| **Make choices concerning style, tone, and degree of complexity that are appropriate to the audience.** | Writing style, vocabulary, and technical depth are consistently calibrated to the stated audience. Tone is professional and appropriate. | Writing style is mostly appropriate for the audience, with occasional lapses in tone or technical depth. | Writing style does not consistently match the audience. Tone may be too informal, too technical, or inconsistent. | No evidence of audience awareness. Writing style is inappropriate. |

## Notes

- The **case study** is the key addition that resolves the Written Communication gap. It's authentic to professional design practice — designers write case studies for portfolios routinely — so it doesn't feel like a bolted-on academic exercise.
- The **formative feedback** requirement is addressed through the 4-milestone critique cycle (weeks 2-3, 5, 7-8, 10) that applies to both deliverables.
- The **integration of knowledge** criterion is addressed by framing the practicum project as requiring skills from across the full curriculum (foundation through advanced courses).
- If the reviewer asks about the visual/written balance: the design project is the primary deliverable demonstrating disciplinary mastery; the case study is the vehicle for demonstrating written communication competency. Both are assessed. Both are standard professional practice in the field.
