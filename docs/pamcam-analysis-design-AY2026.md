# PAMCAM Analysis: EWU Design Department — 

# AY 2023-24 & 2024-25

**Date:** February 2026
**Model Reference:** PAMCAM User Manual, L. M. Smith, May 2025
**Data Source:** `workload-data.json` — AY 2023-24 (Year 1) and AY 2024-25 (Year 2)
**FTEF Rule:** Every non-adjunct faculty member = 1.0 FTEF (per IR methodology)
**Status:** Estimated — pending exact financial parameters from Institutional Research

---

## Executive Summary

Using the two most recent complete academic years (2023-24 and 2024-25) and the IR rule that every non-adjunct faculty counts as 1.0 FTEF:

| | AY 2023-24 (Year 1) | AY 2024-25 (Year 2) | Change |
|--|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Total SCH** | 6,226 | 5,818 | -408 (-6.6%) |
| **FTES** | 138.4 | 129.3 | -9.1 (-6.6%) |
| **FTEF** | 9.0 | 8.0 | -1.0 |
| **SFR** | 15.38 | 16.16 | +0.78 |
| **Est. Contribution Margin** | ~$1,187K | ~$1,147K | -$40K |

> **Data correction:** Simeon Mills teaches an ITGS 110 section each Fall (5 credits, 25 students, always fills) that is not captured under the DESN prefix in the scheduling system. The figures above include this correction (+125 SCH per year). If IR's data also misses this course, Design's actual FTES is higher than what PAMCAM sees.

Design's SFR is approximately **15-16** — well below the university average for lecture-based programs (20-25+). At a standard R_max of 18-20, **PAMCAM would recommend cutting 1-2 FTEF**. At a studio-appropriate R_max of 15-16, the recommendation is neutral.

The department lost 1 FTEF between years (a faculty departure) but enrollment declined by less in proportion, causing SFR to actually *improve* from 15.38 to 16.16. Design remains profitable with an estimated contribution margin above $1.1M (base salary only — lower with benefits included).

## 1. PAMCAM Model Overview

PAMCAM (Personnel Allocation Model Contribution Margin Assessment Model) evaluates academic programs using a contribution margin formula:

```
m = (t + a·f - s/R) · n
```

| Variable | Definition | Unit |
|----------|-----------|------|
| m | Annual contribution margin | $ |
| t | Weighted avg annual tuition per student | $/FTES |
| a | Weighted avg annual credit hours per student | SCH/FTES |
| f | Weighted avg annual state formula funding per SCH | $/SCH |
| s | Weighted avg annual salary per faculty | $/FTEF |
| R | Student-faculty ratio | FTES/FTEF |
| n | Annualized enrollment | FTES |

The model recommends a change in faculty (dp) to position a program at maximum financial efficiency:

```
dp = n_final / R_max - p_initial
```

A negative dp means PAMCAM recommends **reducing** faculty. A positive dp means **hiring**.

## 3. AY 2024-25 — Year 2

### 3a. Full-Time Faculty (FTEF = 1.0 each)

| Faculty | Sections | Students | SCH |
|---------|:--------:|:--------:|:---:|
| Ariel Sopu | 12 | 148 | 718 |
| Simeon Mills | 16 | 165 | 795 |
| Sonja Durr | 11 | 151 | 749 |
| Travis Masingale | 20 | 136 | 632 |

| Meg Lybbert | 8 | 99 | 489 |
| Melinda Breen (Chair) | 12 | 65 | 308 |
| Colin Manikoth | 9 | 94 | 460 |
| **Subtotal (8 FTEF)** | **99** | **957** | **4,636** |

> Note: Jamin Kuhn departed between years. Travis Masingale returned from sabbatical and shows 20 sections (includes applied learning). Melinda Breen has full chair release but still generates SCH through applied learning sections. Simeon Mills's totals include ITGS 110 (Fall, 5 cr, 25 students).

### 3b. Adjunct / Former Faculty

| Instructor | Sections | Students | SCH | Status |
|-----------|:--------:|:--------:|:---:|--------|
| Allan Pettigrew | 5 | 81 | 405 | Former (still teaching) |
| Shelby Allison | 3 | 54 | 270 | Adjunct |
| Chris Thompson | 3 | 25 | 125 | Adjunct |
| James Braukman | 2 | 18 | 90 | Adjunct |
| Carl Heidle | 1 | 20 | 100 | Adjunct |
| Erica Norris | 1 | 22 | 110 | Adjunct |
| Dean Davis | 1 | 14 | 70 | Adjunct |
| Tiffany Patterson | 1 | 6 | 12 | Adjunct |
| **Subtotal** | **17** | **240** | **1,182** |

### 3c. Year 2 Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|:-----:|
| **Total SCH (all instructors)** | **5,818** |
| **FTES (5,818 ÷ 45)** | **129.3** |
| **FTEF (non-adjunct)** | **8.0** |
| **SFR (FTES ÷ FTEF)** | **16.16** |
| Total Sections | 116 |
| Total Student Seats | 1,197 |

---

## 4. Year-over-Year Trend

| Metric | 2023-24 | 2024-25 | Change | Direction |
|--------|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Total SCH | 6,226 | 5,818 | -408 | Declining |
| FTES | 138.4 | 129.3 | -9.1 (-6.6%) | Declining |
| FTEF | 9.0 | 8.0 | -1.0 (-11.1%) | Reduced |
| SFR | 15.38 | 16.16 | +0.78 (+5.1%) | Improving |
| Sections | 106 | 116 | +10 | More sections |
| Student seats | 1,325 | 1,197 | -128 | Declining |
| Non-adjunct SCH | 5,282 | 4,636 | -646 | Declining |
| Adjunct SCH | 944 | 1,182 | +238 | Growing |

**Key observations:**

1. **FTES declined 6.6%** — enrollment pressure is real, driven by both fewer students per section and overall demand shifts.
2. **FTEF dropped by 1.0** — losing Jamin Kuhn reduced the denominator, which *improved* SFR. This is the PAMCAM "efficiency" paradox: losing faculty can make the numbers look better.
3. **SFR improved from 15.4 to 16.2** — because FTEF dropped proportionally more than FTES. The department naturally moved toward a more PAMCAM-favorable ratio.
4. **Adjunct reliance increased** — adjunct SCH grew from 944 to 1,182 (+25%), meaning more of the enrollment is being covered by non-FTEF instructors. This improves PAMCAM scores but raises quality and continuity concerns.
5. **Section count increased despite fewer students** — more sections serving fewer students means smaller average class sizes, which hurts SFR.

### 4a. Contextual Factors Not Captured by the Model

PAMCAM is a purely formulaic model — it takes FTES, FTEF, and financial parameters as inputs and produces a recommendation. **It has no mechanism to adjust for temporary circumstances that depress SCH output without reflecting actual enrollment decline.** The following factors affected the data years but are invisible to the model:

**AY 2023-24 (Year 1):**
- **Travis Masingale on sabbatical** — counted as 1.0 FTEF but teaching a modified load (13 sections, 600 SCH). A normal year would generate higher SCH.

**AY 2024-25 (Year 2):**
- **Ginelle Hustrulid — Faculty Organization release time.** Elected Faculty Org representative, teaching a reduced load. Generated 485 SCH vs. a peer average of ~750 SCH. This alone accounts for ~265 SCH of the year-over-year decline — roughly **60% of the 408 SCH drop** attributed to "declining enrollment" is actually institutional service.
- **Melinda Breen — sabbatical Winter 2025.** Chair took sabbatical one quarter, creating a cascade: adjuncts were needed to cover both her courses and the courses of faculty who shifted to cover her responsibilities (slide effect). Her full-year SCH of 308 is lower than it would otherwise be, though adjunct backfill captured some of that SCH under non-FTEF instructors.

**AY 2025-26 (not in PAMCAM window, but relevant for context):**
- **Ginelle Hustrulid — Faculty Org president.** Only teaching 15 scheduled credits this year. Adjunct backfill: 1 adjunct Fall, 0 Winter, 2 Spring. If 2025-26 is used in a future PAMCAM cycle, this will further depress the numbers.

**What this means for the PAMCAM review:**

The apparent 6.6% FTES decline from Year 1 to Year 2 is **not primarily an enrollment story — it is a staffing circumstance story.** If Ginelle had been teaching her normal load in 2024-25, the department's SCH would have been approximately 6,083 (vs. 5,818 actual), and the FTES decline would have been closer to 2-3% rather than 6.6%.

PAMCAM has no affordance for this distinction. The model sees lower SCH and recommends cutting faculty, when the actual cause is faculty performing institutional service that benefits the university. **The department should present this context alongside the PAMCAM numbers** and argue that:

1. The Year 2 SCH figure is temporarily depressed by ~265 SCH due to Faculty Org release time
2. Normalizing for this, the "true" SFR for 2024-25 would be approximately **16.7** (not 16.2)
3. The SCH decline is not evidence of a structural enrollment problem requiring faculty cuts

## 5. PAMCAM Calculations

### 5a. Contribution Margin Estimate

Using estimated financial parameters (pending verification from IR):

| Parameter | Estimated Value | Notes |
|-----------|:--------------:|-------|
| t (tuition/FTES) | $8,000 | EWU in-state, approximate |
| a (SCH/FTES) | 45 | Quarter system standard |
| f (state funding/SCH) | $150 | Washington state, approximate |
| s (salary/FTEF) | $95,000 | Blended base salary estimate (see below) |

**Known base salaries (AY 2024-25):**

| Faculty | Rank | Base Salary | Source |
|---------|------|:-----------:|--------|
| Ginelle Hustrulid | Asst. Professor | $110,000 | Known |
| Travis Masingale | Assoc. Professor | $110,000 | Known |
| Melinda Breen | Full Professor | $125,000 | Known |
| Colin Manikoth | Senior Lecturer | $85,000 | Known |
| Simeon Mills | Asst. Professor | ~$105,000 | Est. (same rank as Ginelle) |
| Sonja Durr | Senior Lecturer | ~$85,000 | Est. (same rank as Colin) |
| Meg Lybbert | Senior Lecturer | ~$85,000 | Est. (same rank as Colin) |
| Ariel Sopu | Lecturer | ~$60,000 | Est. |
| **Blended average (8 FTEF)** | | **~$95,600** | |

> Note: These are base salaries only. PAMCAM's `s` variable should include benefits (typically +30-35% at public universities). With benefits, the effective `s` could be $125-130K/FTEF, which would reduce the contribution margin. The calculations below use **$95K base only** — actual margins will be lower.

**Year 1 (2023-24):**
```
m = ($8,000 + 45 × $150 - $95,000/15.38) × 138.4
m = ($8,000 + $6,750 - $6,176) × 138.4
m = $8,574 × 138.4
m ≈ $1,187,000
```

**Year 2 (2024-25):**
```
m = ($8,000 + 45 × $150 - $95,000/16.16) × 129.3
m = ($8,000 + $6,750 - $5,878) × 129.3
m = $8,872 × 129.3
m ≈ $1,147,000
```

**Design is profitable in both years.** The contribution margin per student *increased* (from $8,574 to $8,872) due to the improved SFR, but total margin decreased because enrollment declined. The break-even SFR is approximately **6.44** — Design operates well above break-even.

> **Sensitivity to salary:** If `s` includes benefits at $125K/FTEF, Year 2 margin drops to ~$741K. If `s` = $130K, margin drops to ~$691K. Design remains profitable in all scenarios, but the margin narrows. This is why getting the actual `s` value from IR is critical.

### 5b. Recommended Change in Faculty (dp)

Using Year 2 (2024-25) as the final state: `dp = 129.3 / R_max - 8.0`

| R_max | dp | Interpretation |
|:-----:|:--:|----------------|
| **25** (large lecture standard) | 129.3/25 - 8 = **-2.83** | Cut ~3 faculty — devastating |
| **20** (university default) | 129.3/20 - 8 = **-1.54** | Cut ~1.5 faculty |
| **18** (generous for mixed) | 129.3/18 - 8 = **-0.82** | Cut ~1 faculty |
| **16** (studio-appropriate) | 129.3/16 - 8 = **+0.08** | Effectively neutral |
| **15** (studio pedagogy) | 129.3/15 - 8 = **+0.62** | Hire 0.6 faculty |
| **14** (small studio) | 129.3/14 - 8 = **+1.24** | Hire 1.2 faculty |

Using Year 1 (2023-24) as the baseline: `dp = 138.4 / R_max - 9.0`

| R_max | dp | Interpretation |
|:-----:|:--:|----------------|
| **25** | 138.4/25 - 9 = **-3.46** | Cut ~3.5 faculty |
| **20** | 138.4/20 - 9 = **-2.08** | Cut ~2 faculty |
| **18** | 138.4/18 - 9 = **-1.31** | Cut ~1.3 faculty |
| **16** | 138.4/16 - 9 = **-0.35** | Cut ~0.4 faculty |
| **15** | 138.4/15 - 9 = **+0.23** | Hire 0.2 faculty |
| **14** | 138.4/14 - 9 = **+0.89** | Hire 0.9 faculty |

**The R_max setting remains the most consequential input.** At R_max = 18-20, PAMCAM recommends cutting 1-2 positions. At R_max = 15-16, the recommendation is neutral or slightly positive.

## 6. Why Design's SFR Is Below University Averages

### 6a. Structural Factors (Legitimate, Not Inefficiency)

| Factor | Impact on PAMCAM | Reality |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Studio class caps (20-25) | Low SFR → high cost/student | Required for hands-on instruction, equipment access, critique format |
| Applied learning (499/495/491) | 1-5 students per section, minimal SCH generated | Required for degree completion; high-touch mentorship |
| Chair release | 1.0 FTEF salary, reduced or 0 FTEF teaching | Standard academic governance; every department has this |
| 5-credit courses | Fewer sections per faculty per quarter | EWU institutional standard, not a Design choice |
| Foundation pipeline (100/216/263) | Lower enrollment in early sections | Normal for gateway courses; feed upper-division enrollment |

### 6b. Data Factors That May Be Addressable

| Factor | Impact | Potential Action |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Cross-listed teaching (ITCS 110) | SCH generated goes to another department, not DESN | Clarify with IR how cross-listed teaching is counted |
| Fall enrollment softness | Multiple sections at 10-16 students vs. 20 cap | Could consolidate some Fall sections |
| Inconsistent load reporting | System data may undercount some faculty teaching activity | Ensure all teaching is accurately captured before the review |
| Single-student sections (DESN 399, etc.) | Near-zero SCH for faculty load consumed | Evaluate whether these offerings are necessary annually |
| Chair sections counting in FTEF | Chair generates low SCH but counts as 1.0 FTEF | Argue that chair duties should be treated as institutional overhead |

---

## 7. Scenario: A Lecturer Position Is Lost

### Impact on PAMCAM Metrics (from Year 2 baseline)

| Metric | Current (8 FTEF) | Without 1 Faculty (7 FTEF) | Change |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| FTEF | 8.0 | 7.0 (-1.0) | Improved ratio |
| FTES (if courses cut) | 129.3 | ~111 (-18) | Reduced revenue |
| FTES (if adjuncts cover) | 129.3 | ~129.3 | Revenue maintained |
| SFR (courses cut) | 16.16 | 15.9 | Slightly worse |
| SFR (adjuncts cover) | 16.16 | 18.5 | Significantly improved |

**The PAMCAM paradox:** Losing a faculty member and replacing with cheaper adjuncts actually *improves* the PAMCAM score — FTEF cost drops, and if enrollment is maintained, the contribution margin increases. This is exactly the kind of move PAMCAM incentivizes.

**The 2-year trap:** If foundation courses (DESN 100/216/263) are cut rather than covered, enrollment drops within 1-2 years as the pipeline empties, making the *next* PAMCAM cycle worse. This is a critical point to make to administration.

---

## 8. Recommendations for PAMCAM Advocacy

### 8a. Argue for an Appropriate R_max

This is the single most important lever. The department should propose **R_max = 15-16** based on:

- **NASAD accreditation standards** — studio courses require small class sizes for adequate critique, equipment access, and individualized instruction
- **Physical space constraints** — Design labs have fixed workstation counts (typically 20-25 seats)
- **Equipment-to-student ratios** — Each student needs a dedicated workstation with licensed software during class time
- **Peer comparison** — Other accredited design programs operate at similar SFRs
- **Learning outcomes** — Studio pedagogy is fundamentally different from lecture pedagogy

### 8b. Ensure Data Accuracy Before the Review

1. **Verify how chair duties are counted** — If the chair counts as 1.0 FTEF with minimal teaching, that's a significant drag on SFR. Argue that chair duties should be treated as institutional overhead.
2. **Clarify cross-listed teaching** — Any SCH generated in courses outside the DESN prefix (e.g., ITCS 110) should be attributed to Design if a Design faculty member is teaching them.
3. **Confirm all teaching activity is captured** — System data may undercount some faculty loads (e.g., overload sections, split-listed courses).
4. **Ensure applied learning is counted** — 499/495/491 sections generate real SCH (albeit small). Verify they're included in FTES calculations.

### 8c. Leverage the Trend Story

The data actually tells a positive SFR story:
- SFR *improved* from 15.38 to 16.16 year-over-year
- The department already absorbed a faculty loss (Jamin Kuhn) and adapted
- Adjunct coverage increased naturally to fill gaps
- Per-student contribution margin increased ($8,574 → $8,872)

Frame the narrative: Design is already becoming more efficient without external pressure. Another cut would tip the balance from optimization into harm.

### 8d. Prepare the Pipeline Argument

If administration uses PAMCAM to justify cutting a position:

- DESN 100 is the gateway course — every Design major starts here
- Cutting foundation sections reduces new student intake by an estimated 40-60 students/year
- Upper-division enrollment will decline by the same amount within 2 years
- This creates a death spiral where each PAMCAM cycle looks worse, leading to more cuts
- **Present enrollment pipeline data** showing the direct connection between foundation section capacity and 3rd/4th year enrollment

### 8e. Reframe the Contribution Margin Story

Design is **profitable** at an estimated $1.15M contribution margin (base salary; ~$700-750K with benefits). The argument should be:
- Design generates revenue exceeding its direct costs
- The break-even SFR is only 6.44 (base) to ~8.5 (with benefits) — Design operates well above break-even
- The question isn't whether Design is profitable (it is), but whether it's "efficient enough" relative to other programs
- Studio-based instruction is inherently more expensive per student — this is true at every university
- The relevant comparison is against peer Design programs, not against English or Business courses with 200-seat lectures

## 9. Data Gaps and Next Steps

To produce a definitive PAMCAM analysis, the following data is needed from Institutional Research:

| Data Needed | Why |
|------------|-----|
| IR's exact FTES calculation for DESN | Verify our 138.4 (Y1) and 129.3 (Y2) estimates |
| IR's exact FTEF calculation | Confirm the 1.0 per non-adjunct rule; how is chair release handled? |
| Average tuition per FTES (t) | May differ from sticker price due to financial aid, waivers |
| State funding formula per SCH (f) | May vary by discipline (arts vs. sciences vs. business) |
| Average salary + benefits per FTEF (s) | We estimate ~$95K base; benefits multiplier (typically +30-35%) is unknown |
| Administration's proposed R_max | **This is the single number that determines whether dp is -2 or 0** |
| IR's projected enrollment for DESN | Official projection, not our internal estimate |
| Whether former faculty (e.g., Pettigrew) SCH counts | He taught 5 sections in 2024-25 as "former" — where does that SCH go? |
| Whether ITGS 110 SCH is attributed to Design | Simeon Mills teaches this course but it has a non-DESN prefix — IR may or may not count it under Design |

---

## Appendix: Sensitivity Analysis

### dp by R_max and Enrollment (Year 2 baseline, FTEF = 8.0)

| | R_max = 14 | R_max = 16 | R_max = 18 | R_max = 20 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **FTES = 110** (declining) | -0.14 | -1.13 | -1.89 | -2.50 |
| **FTES = 120** (slight decline) | +0.57 | -0.50 | -1.33 | -2.00 |
| **FTES = 129.3** (current Year 2) | +1.24 | +0.08 | -0.82 | -1.54 |
| **FTES = 138.4** (Year 1 level) | +1.89 | +0.65 | -0.31 | -1.08 |
| **FTES = 150** (growth target) | +2.71 | +1.38 | +0.33 | -0.50 |

### dp by R_max and Enrollment (Year 1 baseline, FTEF = 9.0)

| | R_max = 14 | R_max = 16 | R_max = 18 | R_max = 20 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **FTES = 110** | -1.14 | -2.13 | -2.89 | -3.50 |
| **FTES = 129.3** | +0.24 | -0.92 | -1.82 | -2.54 |
| **FTES = 138.4** (actual Year 1) | +0.89 | -0.35 | -1.31 | -2.08 |
| **FTES = 150** | +1.71 | +0.38 | -0.67 | -1.50 |

**Key takeaway:** At current Year 2 enrollment (129.3 FTES), Design is essentially neutral at R_max = 16 (dp = +0.08). With enrollment recovery to Year 1 levels (~138 FTES), even R_max = 16 is solidly positive (+0.65). The fight for R_max = 16 vs. 18 is the difference between "keep current staffing" and "cut 1 position."
