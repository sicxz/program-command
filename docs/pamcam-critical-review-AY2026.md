# PAMCAM Analysis: Critical Review & Data Verification Checklist

**Date:** February 2026
**Companion to:** `pamcam-analysis-design-AY2026.md`
**Purpose:** Document known data uncertainties, potential inaccuracies, and verification items before the PAMCAM report is used for advocacy

---

## 1. Data Accuracy Questions

### 1a. Meg Lybbert — AY 2023-24 Low Output

Meg Lybbert shows only **6 sections and 372 SCH** in AY 2023-24, which is significantly below her peers (Sonja Durr: 14 sections/768 SCH, Ariel Sopu: 12 sections/819 SCH). In AY 2024-25, her numbers normalize to 8 sections/489 SCH.

**Why this matters:** If Meg had a legitimate reason for reduced teaching in 2023-24 (medical leave, sabbatical, partial-year hire), this is another contextual factor PAMCAM doesn't capture. If the data is simply incomplete (system didn't record some sections), then Year 1 SCH is understated.

**Action needed:** Verify whether Meg's 2023-24 load is accurate or if sections are missing from the data.

### 1b. Travis Masingale — Sabbatical Year Data

Travis shows **13 sections and 600 SCH** in AY 2023-24 while on sabbatical. This is a full-to-heavy teaching load for someone on sabbatical leave. Possibilities:

1. He was on sabbatical for only one quarter and taught normally the other two
2. Some of these sections are applied learning (DESN 499/495) that continued during sabbatical
3. The data is misattributed

**Why this matters:** If Travis was generating 600 SCH while on sabbatical, the "normal" Year 1 output was actually already depressed — his non-sabbatical year would have generated even more SCH, meaning Year 1 baseline is understated.

**Action needed:** Clarify what "sabbatical" means in this context — which quarter(s), and what teaching continued.

### 1c. Jamin Kuhn — Low Output Year

Jamin Kuhn shows only **4 sections and 155 SCH** in AY 2023-24 before departing. This could mean:

1. He was already transitioning out (partial-year appointment)
2. He taught primarily low-enrollment sections
3. Data is incomplete

**Why this matters:** With only 155 SCH, Kuhn contributed minimally to Year 1 totals but consumed 1.0 FTEF. His departure *improved* SFR because his FTEF cost was high relative to his SCH output. This supports the argument that Year 1's SFR was artificially low.

**Action needed:** Confirm whether Kuhn was full-time all year or a partial appointment.

## 2. Normalization Argument — Potential Overstatement

### Issue

Section 4a of the PAMCAM report states that Ginelle's Faculty Org release time accounts for ~265 SCH of the year-over-year decline, or "roughly 60% of the 408 SCH drop." This framing may be overstated.

### Why

The 265 SCH figure compares Ginelle's actual output (485 SCH) to a peer average (~750 SCH). However, some of Ginelle's forgone sections were covered by adjunct instructors, and that adjunct SCH *is already included* in the Year 2 total of 5,818. In other words:

- If adjuncts taught sections that Ginelle would have taught, those sections' SCH is captured under adjunct totals
- The "missing" SCH is only the net amount not covered by anyone — not the full 265 SCH

### More Accurate Framing

The 265 SCH represents the gap between Ginelle's actual output and her expected output *as a full-time faculty member*. Some of that gap was filled by adjuncts (who don't count toward FTEF). The net uncaptured SCH loss from Ginelle's release is likely **less than 265** — probably closer to 100-150 SCH after accounting for adjunct backfill. This would represent 25-37% of the year-over-year decline rather than 60%.

**Recommendation:** Soften the Section 4a language to say the release time is "a significant contributing factor" rather than quantifying it at 60%. Or, calculate the exact adjunct backfill attributable to Ginelle's release and subtract it.

## 3. SCH Attribution Uncertainties

### 3a. Allan Pettigrew — "Former" Faculty

Allan Pettigrew appears as "former" in AY 2024-25 but still taught **5 sections generating 405 SCH**. Questions:

1. Does IR count his SCH under the Design department?
2. Is he classified as adjunct or former for FTEF purposes? (He should not count as FTEF if "former")
3. If his SCH is excluded from IR's DESN totals, Year 2 FTES drops from 129.3 to **120.3**, making the SFR picture significantly worse

**Action needed:** Confirm with IR how Pettigrew's SCH is attributed.

### 3b. ITGS 110 — Cross-Prefix Attribution

The report adds +125 SCH/year for Simeon Mills's ITGS 110 section (5 credits × 25 students). However:

1. The 25-student enrollment is an assumption ("always fills") — actual enrollment may vary
2. IR may attribute this SCH to the ITGS/IT department, not Design
3. If IR doesn't count it, arguing for its inclusion requires documentation

**Action needed:**
- Pull actual ITGS 110 enrollment data for both years (not assumed)
- Determine whether IR attributes this SCH to Design or IT

### 3c. Applied Learning SCH

Applied learning courses (DESN 499, 495, 491) have workload multipliers (0.2×, 0.1×, 0.15×) in the scheduling system, but PAMCAM uses raw SCH. If a student takes 5 credits of DESN 499, that's 5 SCH for PAMCAM regardless of the 0.2× workload multiplier.

**Question:** Does IR count applied learning SCH the same as regular course SCH? If yes, these small sections actually help FTES. If IR uses any adjustment, the report's numbers may overstate FTES.

---

## 4. Missing Data

### 4a. Summer Quarter

The workload data appears to include Summer sections in some cases but not consistently. Summer teaching generates SCH that counts toward annual FTES.

**Questions:**
- Does IR include Summer in their FTES calculations?
- Are all Summer sections captured in our data?
- If Summer is excluded, we may be understating FTES for both years

### 4b. Comparative R_max Data

The entire PAMCAM recommendation hinges on R_max. Without knowing:
- What R_max other departments received
- Whether R_max is set uniformly or by discipline
- What the provost's office considers "reasonable" for studio-based programs

...the sensitivity tables in the report are useful but don't tell us where the actual decision will land.

**Action needed:** Request the R_max values being used for the current PAMCAM cycle, or at minimum the university-wide default.

### 4c. Benefits Multiplier

The report uses $95K base salary for the `s` parameter. If PAMCAM uses total compensation (salary + benefits), the actual `s` could be $125-130K/FTEF. This would reduce the contribution margin from ~$1.15M to ~$700-750K.

Design remains profitable either way, but the margin compression matters for how the program compares to lower-cost departments.

**Action needed:** Determine whether IR's `s` parameter includes benefits or is base salary only.

## 5. Verification Checklist

Before presenting the PAMCAM analysis, verify the following with Institutional Research:

| # | Item | Status | Impact if Wrong |
|:-:|------|:------:|-----------------|
| 1 | Meg Lybbert 2023-24 load (6 sections — accurate?) | Unverified | Year 1 SCH understated |
| 2 | Travis sabbatical details (which quarter(s)?) | Unverified | Year 1 baseline interpretation |
| 3 | Jamin Kuhn appointment type (full year?) | Unverified | Year 1 FTEF justification |
| 4 | Allan Pettigrew SCH attribution | Unverified | Year 2 FTES could drop by 9 |
| 5 | ITGS 110 actual enrollment (both years) | Assumed at 25 | ±25 SCH per year |
| 6 | ITGS 110 departmental attribution | Unverified | ±125 SCH per year |
| 7 | Applied learning SCH counting method | Unverified | Affects FTES calculation |
| 8 | Summer quarter inclusion | Unverified | Could understate FTES |

| 10 | Benefits inclusion in salary (s) | Unknown | Contribution margin ±$400K |
| 11 | Adjunct backfill for Ginelle's release (exact sections) | Unverified | Section 4a accuracy |
| 12 | IR's official FTES/FTEF for Design (both years) | Unknown | Could differ from our calculations |

## 6. Recommended Report Revisions

Based on this review, consider the following changes to the main PAMCAM report before using it for advocacy:

1. **Soften the 60% normalization claim** in Section 4a — either calculate the net (after adjunct backfill) or use qualitative language ("a significant contributing factor")
2. **Add a footnote on Meg Lybbert's 2023-24 numbers** — flag them as potentially incomplete pending verification
3. **Add uncertainty ranges to FTES** — e.g., "129.3 FTES (±9 depending on Pettigrew attribution)"
4. **Move ITGS 110 to a conditional line item** — show both "with ITGS" and "without ITGS" totals until IR confirms attribution
5. **Add a benefits scenario to the contribution margin** — show the $125K/FTEF case alongside the $95K case
6. **Document the sabbatical quarter(s)** for Travis once confirmed, to strengthen the contextual factors argument

---

## Summary

The PAMCAM analysis report is directionally sound — Design is profitable, SFR is improving, and the R_max argument is the correct strategic focus. However, several data points are assumed or unverified, and the normalization argument in Section 4a may overstate the case. Resolving the 12 items in the verification checklist would strengthen the report's credibility and ensure it holds up under scrutiny during the review process.

The highest-priority items are:
1. **R_max** — without this, everything else is sensitivity analysis
2. **Allan Pettigrew's SCH attribution** — could shift Year 2 FTES by 9 points
3. **Benefits multiplier** — determines whether the contribution margin is $1.15M or $700K
4. **ITGS 110 attribution** — 125 SCH/year affects the SFR calculation
