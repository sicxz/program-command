# Impact Analysis: Losing One Lecturer — AY 2025-26

**Date:** February 2026
**Scenario:** A lecturer (Lecturer, 45-credit load) departs. Can 7 remaining full-time faculty cover AY 2025-26?

---

## Executive Summary

**No. The department cannot absorb a 45-credit lecturer loss internally.** The 7 remaining faculty have only **18 credits of spare capacity** (all from Mindy's chair-reduced load). This leaves a **27-credit shortfall** — roughly 5-6 sections with no instructor. Covering the gap requires a combination of adjunct hiring, increased overloads, and possible course reductions.

---

## 1. Current Faculty Workloads (AY 2025-26)

| Faculty | Rank | Current Load | Capacity | Spare | Utilization |
|---------|------|:------------:|:--------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| Travis Masingale | Assoc. Professor | 36 (31+5 DESN 499) | 36 | 0 | 100% |
| Ginelle Hustrulid | Asst. Professor | 36 (31+5 DESN 499) | 36 | 0 | 100% |
| Melinda Breen (Mindy) | Full Professor / Chair | 18 | 36 | **18** | 50% |
| Colin Manikoth | Senior Lecturer | 36 | 36 | 0 | 100% |
| Sonja Durr | Senior Lecturer | 45 | 45 | 0 | 100% |
| Simeon Mills (Sam) | Asst. Professor | 45 | 36 | **-9** | 125% |
| Meg Lybbert | Senior Lecturer | 45 | 45 | 0 | 100% |
| **Total** | | **261** | **270** | **18** | |

> **Note:** Sam is already 9 credits over his rank-based limit (36 for Asst. Professor). His individual capacity is set to 45 in the system, but this represents an existing overload. Mindy's 18-credit spare is constrained by full chair release duties.

## 2. Foundations Lecturer Course Load (To Be Redistributed)

A lecturer teaches **9 sections** of 3 foundation-level courses across all 3 quarters:

### Fall Quarter (15 credits)

| Course | Section | Credits | Enrolled | Level |
|--------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|-------|
| DESN 100 — Intro to Design | 001 | 5 | 10 | Foundation |
| DESN 216 — Typography | 001 | 5 | 16 | Foundation |
| DESN 263 — Design Principles | 040 | 5 | 12 | Foundation |

### Winter Quarter (15 credits)

| Course | Section | Credits | Enrolled | Level |
|--------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|-------|
| DESN 100 — Intro to Design | 001 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |
| DESN 216 — Typography | 001 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |
| DESN 263 — Design Principles | 040 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |

### Spring Quarter (15 credits)

| Course | Section | Credits | Enrolled | Level |
|--------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|-------|
| DESN 100 — Intro to Design | 001 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |
| DESN 216 — Typography | 001 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |
| DESN 263 — Design Principles | 040 | 5 | 20 | Foundation |

**Total:** 45 credits, 9 sections, 158 students

All foundation courses are 100-200 level foundation courses. This is significant — foundation courses are pipeline courses that feed upper-division enrollment. Cutting them reduces future enrollment across the program.

---

## 3. Existing Adjunct Coverage (AY 2025-26)

The department already relies on adjuncts and other instructors for 55 credits:

| Instructor | Status | Courses | Credits |
|-----------|--------|---------|:-------:|
| Allan Pettigrew | Former | DESN 216 x3 (F/W/S) | 15 |
| Shelby Allison | Adjunct | DESN 100 x2 (F/W) | 10 |
| "Adjunct" (unnamed) | Adjunct | DESN 336 (W), DESN 350 (S) | 10 |
| "TBD" (unassigned) | TBD | DESN 490 x2 (W/S) | 10 |
| Erica Norris | Adjunct | DESN 305 (S) | 5 |
| James Braukman | Adjunct | DESN 384 (S) | 5 |
| **Total** | | **11 sections** | **55** |

Allan Pettigrew (former faculty) is already covering 3 sections of DESN 216 — the same course already taught. This means DESN 216 has 6 total sections per year, 3 of which are taught by a lecturer.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis

### Capacity Math

```
Total AY 2025-26 demand (full-time):          261 credits (7 faculty)
                                              + 45 credits (lecturer courses)
                                              ─────────────
                                              = 306 credits

Remaining 7 faculty capacity:                  270 credits
                                              (with Sam's overload counted at 45)

Available spare across all 7:                   18 credits (Mindy only)

Shortfall:                                      45 - 18 = 27 credits
                                              = 5-6 five-credit sections uncovered
```

### Quarter-by-Quarter Load Analysis

How many courses each faculty member teaches per quarter currently, and how many sections per quarter could be absorb:

| Faculty | Fall | Winter | Spring | Courses/Qtr Norm | Can Absorb? |
|---------|:----:|:------:|:------:|:----------------:|-------------|
| Travis | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | At limit |
| Ginelle | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1* | Data incomplete — user says 31 cr |
| Mindy | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 (chair) | Could take 1/qtr if chair allows |
| Colin | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2-3 | At/near limit |
| Sonja | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2-4 | At limit, Fall is 4 courses |
| Sam | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2-3 | Already overloaded |
| Meg | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2-4 | At limit, Winter is 4 courses |

> *Ginelle shows only 15 scheduled credits (3 courses, 1/quarter) in the system, but you reported 31. She likely has additional assignments not yet reflected in the data.

**Key bottlenecks:**
- **Fall:** Sonja already teaches 4 courses, Sam teaches 3 (with ITCS 110). Very few faculty have room.
- **Winter:** Meg already teaches 4 courses. Limited absorption capacity.
- **Spring:** Slightly more room — most faculty at 2 courses — but still no one with true spare annual capacity.

---

## 5. Redistribution Scenarios

### Scenario A: Internal Absorption Only (Overloads)

Assumes Mindy takes on 1 course per quarter (18 credits) and remaining 27 credits are overloads:

| Faculty | Additional Sections | New Total | Over Capacity By |
|---------|:-------------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| Mindy | +3 (1/qtr) | 33 | — (within 36) |
| Travis | +1 (any quarter) | 41 | +5 over 36 |
| Colin | +1 (Winter or Spring) | 41 | +5 over 36 |
| Meg | +1 (Fall or Spring) | 50 | +5 over 45 |
| Ginelle | +1 (any quarter) | 41 | +5 over 36 |
| **Remaining uncovered** | | **15 credits (3 sections)** | |

**Result:** Even with 4 faculty taking overloads AND Mindy teaching 3 courses, **3 sections still have no instructor.** This also assumes Mindy's chair duties can accommodate teaching, which may not be viable.

**Problems:**
- Requires 4+ faculty to exceed contractual workload limits
- Mindy's chair release is full — teaching conflicts with those duties
- Sam is already 9 credits over rank limit
- Overloads may require union/HR approval and additional compensation

### Scenario B: Adjunct Expansion (Recommended)

Hire adjunct(s) to cover the foundation courses, supplemented by minimal internal redistribution:

| Action | Credits Covered | Cost Level |
|--------|:--------------:|:----------:|
| Hire 1 adjunct for DESN 100 (3 sections, F/W/S) | 15 | ~$15K |
| Hire 1 adjunct for DESN 263 (3 sections, F/W/S) | 15 | ~$15K |
| Mindy absorbs DESN 216 (1 section, any quarter) | 5 | — |
| Expand Shelby Allison by 1 section of DESN 216 | 5 | ~$5K |
| Allan Pettigrew picks up remaining DESN 216 section if available | 5 | ~$5K |
| **Total covered** | **45** | |

**Result:** Full coverage. 2 new adjuncts needed, plus expansion of 2 existing instructors. Mindy takes on a modest 1-course load.

**Advantages:**
- No overloads for full-time faculty
- Foundation pipeline maintained
- Adjuncts teaching foundation courses is common practice
- DESN 100, 216, and 263 are standardized enough for adjunct instruction

**Risks:**
- Adjunct hiring pool for design may be limited
- Quality control for 3 foundation courses taught by new hires
- Budget approval required for ~$35-40K additional adjunct spend

### Scenario C: Course Reduction

Eliminate or reduce sections instead of replacing the lecturer

| Reduction | Sections Cut | Students Displaced | Credits Saved |
|-----------|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Drop 1 section of DESN 100 per quarter | 3 | ~50 | 15 |
| Drop 1 section of DESN 263 per quarter | 3 | ~52 | 15 |
| Combine sections DESN 216 sections  (increase class size to ~35) | 3 | 0 (absorbed) | 15 |
| **Total** | **9 sections** | **~102 students** | **45** |

**Result:** Technically feasible, but severely damages the program pipeline.

**Problems:**
- DESN 100 is the gateway course — cutting sections directly reduces new student intake
- DESN 263 is a required foundation course — bottleneck for degree progression
- Larger DESN 216 sections (35 students) strain studio-based instruction
- Reduced course access extends time-to-graduation for current students
- Likely causes enrollment decline in upper-division courses within 1-2 years

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Pursue Scenario B (Adjunct Expansion)** as the primary strategy. The 27-credit gap is too large for overloads alone, and course cuts undermine the program pipeline.

2. **Prioritize DESN 100 coverage.** This is the gateway course. Losing sections directly reduces new student intake into the Design major. Shelby Allison already teaches DESN 100 — explore expanding her to 3 quarters (add Spring) for continuity.

3. **Explore whether if an adjunct can absorb DESN 216 sections.** He already teaches DESN 216 three quarters. If he can teach a second section per quarter (moving from 15 to 30 credits), that covers DESN 216 entirely without a new hire.

4. **DESN 263 is the hardest to cover internally.** No current adjunct teaches it. This is the course most likely to require a new adjunct hire or a full-time faculty overload.

5. **If Mindy can teach 1 course per quarter**, that covers 15 of the 45 credits and brings the adjunct need down to ~2 new hires instead of 3. Assess whether chair duties allow this.

6. **Begin adjunct recruitment immediately.** Design-qualified adjuncts may be scarce. The Fall quarter start is the hard deadline — Winter/Spring are secondary targets if phased hiring is needed.
